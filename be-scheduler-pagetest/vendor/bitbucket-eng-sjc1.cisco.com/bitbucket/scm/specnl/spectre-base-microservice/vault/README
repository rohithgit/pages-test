This client has been developed by hashicorp
It has a Mozilla Public License, version 2.0
You can use it and modify the code as much as you want.

Requirements:

Preinstalled software:
    1. Installed golang
    2. Installed and configured vault with connectivity to your project.

Golang project:
    1. Create your workspace
    2. Setup the GOPATH environment variable

Vault client:
    Vault API gives you full access to the Vault
    !!! You need to prepare your Config struct to start your client !!!
    Check the line 35 in client.go for more details 

Transport:
    The API is expected to be accessed over a TLS connection at all times,
    with a valid certificate that is verified by a vault client.

Unsealed:
    Unsealing is done via an unauthenticated unseal API.
    This API takes a single master shard and progresses the unsealing process. 
    Once all shards are given, the Vault is either unsealed or
    resets the unsealing process if the key was invalid.

Authentication:
    Once the Vault is unsealed, every other operation requires authentication. There are multiple methods for authentication that can be enabled
    Authentication is done with the login endpoint. The login endpoint returns an access token that is set as the X-Vault-Token header.


That should be enough to connect to the vault
For more information please refer to the Vault spec which can be found :
