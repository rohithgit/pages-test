ABOUT:

This is a memcache client library which can connect to hazelcast cluster. The package can be imported and consumed from other golang packages.


INSTALLATION:

Run the docker-compose file. Currently, the hazelcast-docker-compose has a cluster of hazelcast comprising of 2 nodes. You can add more in similar way

For instance -- 
hazelcastN:
  hostname: hazelcastN
  container_name: hazelcastNN
  image: hazelcast/hazelcast
  ports: [ "5702:5701" ]
  command: java -cp /opt/hazelcast/hazelcast-all-3.6.1.jar -Dhazelcast.memcache.enabled=true -server com.hazelcast.core.server.StartServer

Run it --
docker-compose -f hazelcast-docker-compose.yml up

You have your docker with hazelcast cluster containers.

To test the hazelcast client --

Prerequisities are:
- active and running hazelcast cluster
- golang installed
- gopath is defined

There is one non-standard library that is required for the code and test. Please execute this:

go get -u github.com/bradfitz/gomemcache/memcache 

To get ip address of your hazelcast clusters run this:
docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' $(docker ps -aq)

To test this with your cluster you will have to edit the parameters passed to string array like this
in client_test.go. You can add/remove from inside the {"<ip:port>"}

var args []string = []string{"172.17.0.2:5701", "172.17.0.3:5701"}

Navigate to the hazelcast folder

Run the tests:
go test
