The crypt package provides encryption and decryption helper methods. It can be imported and consumed from other golang packages.
It uses AES 256 CBC with PKCS7 padding and performs base64 encoding and decoding for encryption and decryption respectively. It needs a key which should be 32 bytes long and an IV which should be 16 bytes long.


To test locally:
The prerequisites for testing this project locally are:
- golang is installed (if you have not already: https://golang.org/dl/)
- gopath is defined (if you have not already: https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)


Then this "crypt" folder should be copied into your $GOPATH.

Also we need a few libraries to run the code and test. Please execute these:
go get -u github.com/Sirupsen/logrus
go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify
go get -u github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report
go get -u github.com/axw/gocov/...
go get -u github.com/AlekSi/gocov-xml


Then navigate into "crypt" folder (in a terminal using cd).

Then to run the tests execute:
go test

Then to view code coverage execute:
go test -cover

To generate junit compliant test report execute:
go test -v | go-junit-report > report.xml

To generate coverage report which jenkins can understand:
gocov test | gocov-xml > coverage.xml
